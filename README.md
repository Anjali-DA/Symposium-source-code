# Symposium:R-Prediction 



# Abstract:
Aim of the study :To combat HAI and improve PS by the intervention of EHR.HAI is a major concern for people.
To show the viability of infections the study used a data driven strategy using EHR and SVM.
The HRF(High Risk Factor) can be identified by ML. The data that will be used for developing and training consists of 300rows & 9 variables which would include Age, WBC , Coma scale , heart rate etc.
Probable accuracy to be achieved 89%on test set,75%Precision ,80% Recall,77%F1-score ,RoC AUC score of 0.86 Confusion Matrix would accurately predict 37/45 instances. Overall it will be result oriented and SVM is a promising ML algorithm for HAI , to predict RP and using EHR data could be a valid identification for HAI and preventive measures for HAI
Limitations to the study:
The use of a dummy dataset, which may not fully represent the complexities of real-world EHR data and further research can improve it.
